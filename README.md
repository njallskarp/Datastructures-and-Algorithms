# Data Structures and Algorithms

In this repository I will try to catalog, implement, and explain as many algorithms and data structures as possible. I will, at a high level, divide this repository into three main categories: data structures, algorithms, and coding puzzles / challenges.

With each piece of code, I will try to write accompanying explanations to each one. The main purpose of which is to cement my understanding of each concept in the most detail possible. However, hopefully it will serve as a useful resource for others learning these topics.
